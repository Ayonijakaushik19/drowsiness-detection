# Drowsiness Detection using OpenCV  

Detects eye movements and alerts when the object is drowsy

## Applications

This can be used by riders who tend to drive for a longer period of time that may lead to accidents

### Code Requirements

The example code is in Python (version 2.7 or higher will work).

#### Clone the repository

```javascript
$ git clone https://github.com/dhrubajyoti89/drowsiness-detection.git
```

#### Open the drowsiness-detection Directory

```javascript
$ cd drowsiness-detection
```

#### Make a virtual environment

```javascript
$ pip install virtualenv
```

```javascript
$ virtualenv drowsiness_detection_venv
```

```javascript
$ cd drowsiness_detection_venv
```

#### Activate the virtual environment for Mac & Linux

```javascript
$ source Scripts/activate
```

#### Activate the virtual environment for Windows

```javascript
$ Scripts/activate
```

### Dependencies

1) import cv2 (comes under opencv-python library)
2) import imutils
3) import scipy
4) import dlib

>If you want to run through Jupiter Notebook :

1) install ipykernel

## prerequisites

> dlib library has some prerequisites such as Cmake and some C++ libraries. These prerequisites are essential otherwise the programme may throw **RUN TIME ERRORS**.
>
>**For Windows :** 
[Refer Here](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/how-to-install-dlib-library-for-python-in-windows-10-57348ba1117f)
>
>**For Mac and Linux :** [Refer Here](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2017/03/27/how-to-install-dlib/)

##### Go through the instructions in the above link and complete them first or else the below installation may throw errors

#### Install the dependecies

```javascript
$ cd ..
```

```javascript
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

>Be patient it may take some time.

### Run The Programme

After activating the virtual environment run :

```javascript
$ python Drowsiness_Detection.py
```

### Input

We can run the programme for live detection or even for a given video file (**.avi file**).

**after running the programme**

    press 0 for live detection.

Or

    press 1 to input a video file
    Enter the path :

    example path:(D:\Videos\testfile.avi)

**The input video file must be of .avi format**

### Description

A computer vision system that can automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy.

### Algorithm

Each eye is represented by 6 (x, y)-coordinates, starting at the left-corner of the eye (as if you were looking at the person), and then working clockwise around the eye:.

### Condition

It checks 20 consecutive frames and if the Eye Aspect ratio is less than 0.25, Alert is generated.

### Contributions are welcomed !

First create an issue if you want to add new feauture or want to improve existing code. After that create a Pull Request.

### Raise the PR to the TEST branch !

Make a folder named after `Test` , if the code is platform specific then please create subfolder named to that Operating system within that language folder. For example `Test/Linux`. Add README.md in it telling about compilation, installing dependencies and some screenshots of the updates.
